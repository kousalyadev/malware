Malware Analysis & Cyber Attribution (MA.py)

Malware Analysis & Cyber Attribution (MA.py) is a web-based tool designed for cybersecurity professionals to perform comprehensive malware analysis and cyber attribution. It integrates multiple analysis tools such as YARA, Radare2, and VirusTotal, enabling in-depth examination of files and detailed reporting.

Features

- YARA Scanning: Upload custom YARA rules to scan files for known malicious patterns, and receive detailed match information.
- Radare2 Analysis: Conduct advanced static analysis, generate control flow graphs (CFGs), and export results for further investigation.
- VirusTotal Integration: Check files, URLs, domains, and IP addresses against VirusTotalâ€™s database, with automatic report sharing.
- Email Reporting: Receive detailed analysis reports via email, with customizable templates.
